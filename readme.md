# Fashion MNIST Classification Project

## **Overview**
This project demonstrates the implementation and evaluation of neural network models for image classification on the Fashion MNIST dataset. The models used include:
1. **Sigmoid Activation Model**: A baseline model.
2. **ReLU Activation Model**: Enhanced for faster convergence.
3. **Dropout Regularization Model**: Designed to reduce overfitting.

Each model was trained and evaluated for accuracy, loss trends, and confusion matrices. The project highlights the impact of activation functions and regularization techniques on model performance.

## **Dataset**
The Fashion MNIST dataset contains 70,000 grayscale images (28x28 pixels) across 10 clothing categories:
- Training set: 60,000 images.
- Testing set: 10,000 images.
